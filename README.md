Script for re-encoding .ts files to h264

Requies handbrakecli, note that the script names the full path to it, so either put yours there or update the path in the script.

This uses the 720p preset, so recordings will reduce from 1080i to 720p, I do this because its my preference. I can barely tell the differnce with OTA recordings.

Update the paths to where you record OTA tv shows and movies.
